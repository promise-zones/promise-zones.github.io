  "body": "### Welcome to Promise Zones on Github\r\nThis started as a 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking [Challenge: Data Visualization for Obama Administration's Promise Zones](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/challenge-promise-zone-data).\r\n\r\n### Main Visualization\r\n\r\nThe main (and currently only) visualization we have made so far, compares the unemployment rate to the poverty rate, for each county in the US, and compares those to the Promise Zones.  You can see that here (todo: add link when it's set up).\r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\n\r\nSee the [Github Issues](https://github.com/promise-zones/promise-zones/issues) for a list of things we plan to do.  In the grand scheme of things, we plan to iterate and improve the main visualization, and hope to link it to something based on a map.  We may add additional visualizations in the future based on different data points (and we are open to suggestions!).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project started with @dksmith01, @jonyo, @nkcmr, and @stuagano.  We made the decision to push the project forward, continuing to improve and add to the visualization we came up with.\r\n\r\nWe are open to additional contributors if you are interested in helping our project out!\r\n\r\nTo be clear, we are doing this on our spare time (similar to people donating their time to help any time of civic endeavor like volunteer at soup kitchen, etc). To be even more clear, this is not directly run by the Obama Administration or the government.\r\n",
