### Welcome to Promise Zones on Github

This started as a 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking [Challenge: Data Visualization for Obama Administration's Promise Zones](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/challenge-promise-zone-data).

Our goal is to help visualize how the promise zones stand in comparison with other areas of the US, and to help identify other areas that may be good candidates for future promise zones.

### Future Plans

See the [Github Issues](https://github.com/promise-zones/promise-zones/issues) for a list of things we plan to do.  We plan to iterate and improve the main visualization, and hope to link it to something based on a map.  We may add additional visualizations in the future based on different data points (and we are open to suggestions!).

### Authors and Contributors

The project started with @dksmith01, @jonyo, @nkcmr, and @stuagano.  We made the decision to push the project forward, continuing to improve and add to the visualization we came up with.

We are open to additional contributors if you are interested in helping our project out!

To be clear, we are doing this on our spare time, in response to the national civick hack day challenge. To be even more clear, this is not directly run by the Obama Administration or the government.
