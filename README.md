# Getting Started

These are a few resources developers can use if they want to try out these pages locally, just for fun, or to make improvements for a pull request.

* [How to Set up Pages Locally](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) - Use instructions like you already have a pages repo (this one).
* `bundle exec jekyll serve` - Start up preview [locally at localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
