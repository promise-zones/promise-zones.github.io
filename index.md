### Welcome to Promise Zones on Github

This started as a 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking [Challenge: Data Visualization for Obama Administration's Promise Zones](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/challenge-promise-zone-data).

Our goal is to help visualize how the promise zones stand in comparison with other areas of the US, and to help identify other areas that may be good candidates for future promise zones.

# Visualizations

We currently have [one main visualization], which shows Unemployment rate and Poverty rate on a graph, and shows where each county in the US falls.  It also shows the promise zones in the same graph in red, so you can see how they compare to the rest of the country.  You can also see other "blue" areas that are similar to where the promise zones lie, those may be good candidates for future promise zones.

We have also ranked each location, including the promise zones, by which ones might be good candidates for future promise zones.  It is important to note that this is based on poverty rate and unemployment rates only, right now it does not take into consideration any other factors like crime rates.
